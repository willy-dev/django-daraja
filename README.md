## Installation

To install the package, run

```
$ pip install django_daraja
```

## Examples

### STK Push

An example, to send an STK push prompt to customer phone, then display response message

```python
    from django_daraja.mpesa.core import MpesaClient

    def index(request):
        cl = MpesaClient()
        phone_number = '0700111222'
        amount = 1
        account_reference = 'reference'
        transaction_desc = 'Description'
        callback_url = 'https://api.darajambili.com/express-payment'
        response = cl.stk_push(phone_number, amount, account_reference, transaction_desc, callback_url)
        return HttpResponse(response)
```

On your browser, you will receive a message `Success. Request accepted for processing` on success of the STK push, and on the phone number specified you will receive an MPESA PIN prompt. Once the transaction is complete, you will receive a notification on the callback URL you provided. If you used the exact callback URL in the example above (i.e. https://api.darajambili.com/express-payment), you can head over to https://darajambili.com to view the notification received

### B2C Payment

An example, to perform a BusinessPayment B2C (Business to Customer) transaction

```python
    from django_daraja.mpesa.core import MpesaClient

    def index(request):
        cl = MpesaClient()
        phone_number = '0700111222'
        amount = 1
        transaction_desc = 'Business Payment Description'
        occassion = 'Test business payment occassion'
        callback_url = 'https://api.darajambili.com/b2c/result'
        response = cl.business_payment(phone_number, amount, transaction_desc, callback_url, occassion)
        return HttpResponse(response)

```

On your browser, you will receive a message `Accept the service request successfully.` on success of the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, you will receive a notification on the callback URL you provided. If you used the exact callback URL in the example above (i.e. https://api.darajambili.com/b2c/result), you can head over to https://darajambili.com to view the notification received
